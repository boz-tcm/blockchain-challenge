# `Columbia Engineering FinTech Bootcamp 2023-06 Cohort`

## `Project: Module 18 Blockchain-Challenge`

## Background
> Weâ€™re a fintech engineer working at one of the five largest banks in the world. We were recently promoted to act as the lead developer in decentralized finance team.

## Purpose
> Our task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger will allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.
